The primary aim is to develop an innovative solution to find the medicinal plant 
for their  medicinal usage through advanced image processing technique. The human 
activites affecting the flora and fauna it also affect and cause significance decrease in 
medicinal plant population.so by using image processing we can identify medicinal plant 
,we can protect their population.  

    
 Develop advanced image processing techniques to improve plant identification for 
individuals to understand their usage.  
 Utilize cutting-edge algorithms and machine learning models for a user-friendly 
solution adaptable to various types of medicinal plants identification.  
 Contribute to creating a more inclusive and accessible environment for individuals to 
know about their habitat and suitable climate for their growth.  
 on a global scale when we implanting the techniques it helps to finding cure for some 
chronical disease like cancer by using indigenous medicinal plants.
